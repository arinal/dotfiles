## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:** into any folder of your choice. Note that it doesn't need to be inside `~/.config`.
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:arinal/dotfiles.git
   ```
2. To use the non Hyprland configurations, create symbolic links to the corresponding folders within your `~/.config` directory. For example:
   ```bash
   ln -s /path/to/dotfiles/nvim    ~/.config/nvim
   ln -s /path/to/dotfiles/zathura ~/.config/zathura
   ln -s /path/to/dotfiles/zsh     ~/.config/zsh
   ln -s /path/to/dotfiles/i3      ~/.config/i3
   ```
3. For Hyprland setup:
   - Install [Hyprdots](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots) by following the instructions in its repository.
     This will also install Hyprland. Ideally, this is executed right after a fresh ArchLinux installation.
   - You can find inspiration and customize it to your liking from this repository.
